# Project Overview

This repository contains multiple sub-projects related to **Branch Prediction**, **RISC-V Assembler**, and **ChampSim Cache Miss Reduction**. Each sub-project has its own folder and a dedicated README file for detailed information and instructions.

## Sub-Projects

### 1. Branch Prediction
The Branch Prediction module implements various branch prediction algorithms including one-bit and two-bit predictors, as well as static and dynamic predictors. To learn more and get detailed instructions on how to run this module, please refer to the [Branch Prediction README](./branch-prediction/README.md).

### 2. RISC-V Assembler
A C++ project that converts RISC-V assembly code to machine code. It supports a variety of RISC-V instructions, including R, I, S, SB, U, and UJ formats, as well as assembler directives like `.text`, `.data`, and more. Detailed instructions can be found in the [RISC-V Assembler README](./riscv-assembler/README.md).

### 3. ChampSim Cache Miss Reduction
The ChampSim sub-project focuses on reducing cache misses by remapping addresses to reduce conflict misses, which improves hit rate, AMAT, IPC, and overall performance. Detailed steps for setup and execution can be found in the [ChampSim README](./champsim/README.md).

## General Instructions

For each sub-project, please refer to the individual README files located in their respective directories for specific instructions on setup, execution, and details about the technology used.

- [Branch Prediction README](./branch-prediction/README.md)
- [RISC-V Assembler README](./riscv-assembler/README.md)
- [ChampSim README](./champsim/README.md)

Each module provides step-by-step instructions on how to compile and run the code, as well as example input and expected output formats.
